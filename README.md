# About Me
I'm a passionate and driven Software Engineering student at **Solent University**, **Southampton**, with a strong interest in **full-stack web development** and **backend engineering**. I specialize in using technologies like Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and MySQL to build scalable, data-driven applications, and I'm equally comfortable with front-end tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and EJS to create clean, responsive user interfaces.

Beyond academics, I actively enhance my skills through regular problem-solving on platforms like LeetCode, where I strengthen my understanding of data structures, algorithms, and their complexities. I take pride in writing efficient, maintainable code and enjoy the challenge of debugging and optimizing applications for performance.

With hands-on experience in building RESTful APIs, handling user authentication, and integrating third-party services like Stripe.js, I aim to create secure and user-focused software solutions. I'm proficient with tools like Git, GitHub, npm, POSTMAN, and Mongoose, and have experience with real-time web features using technologies like AJAX and Socket.io.

I'm a strong believer in continuous learning, clean code practices, and teamwork. Whether collaborating on a group project or working independently, I bring a problem-solving mindset and a passion for delivering meaningful tech solutions. Currently, I'm seeking opportunities to apply my skills in real-world environments, grow as a developer, and contribute to impactful projects.
